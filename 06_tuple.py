Tuple Exercises

Please read the note carefully and try to solve the problem below:

"""

"""
1. Write a program to create a tuple to  add 5 different numbers.
    a. find out the length of the tuple
    b. find out the 3rd element of the tuple by accessing it through the index
    c. use `enumerate()` function to map each element with its index and print it using the foreach loop
        - please see the reference to the file 02_data_types/06_tuples.py

"""
# answer 1
numbers = (3,5,6,7,8)

# a
print(numbers.__len__())


# b
print(numbers[2])

# c
for i,v in enumerate(numbers):
    print(i,v)





"""
2. Write a program to create a nested tuple and access different elements of the inner tuple using
   positive and negative index positions.

"""

nes_num = (2,3,4,(5,6,7),(8,9,1))
print(nes_num[3][1])
print(nes_num[4][2])


"""
Bonus:
3. create two different tuples t1 and t2 with different elements inside it
    a. create the next tuple t3 to add all values of t1 and t2 using the destructuring method

    - suppose t1 has (1,6,9,4,3)
    - and t2 has (2,7,8,3,5)
    -t3 must have (1,6,9,4,3,2,7,8,3,5)
    - make sure to use destructuring method using `*` operator in the tuples
"""

t1 = (1,6,9,4,3)
t2 = (2,7,8,3,5)
t3 = (*t1,*t2)
print(t3)
